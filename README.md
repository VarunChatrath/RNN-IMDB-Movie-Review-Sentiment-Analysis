# ðŸŽ¬ IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis (RNN & LSTM)

This project uses **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models to classify IMDB movie reviews as **positive** or **negative**.  
It demonstrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **sequence modeling** for text sentiment analysis, and is **deployed using Streamlit** for real-time predictions.

## ðŸ§© Project Overview
- **Dataset:** IMDB Movie Review Dataset (50,000 reviews)
- **Goal:** Predict whether a movie review is positive or negative
- **Model Used:** RNN and LSTM (TensorFlow/Keras)
- **Preprocessing:** Tokenization, padding sequences, text cleaning
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

---

## ðŸš€ Streamlit Deployment
Users can type their own movie reviews into a text box.  
The app processes the review and instantly predicts:
- **Sentiment:** Positive / Negative  
- **Confidence score** showing model certainty
